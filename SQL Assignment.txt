Q2
Inner Join = 7
Left Outer Join = 10
Right Outer Join = 14
Full Outer Join = 17
Cross Join = 7 (since we have a condition T1.id = T2.id, it'll act as inner join), otherwise 72.
Union All = 18
Union = 18
 
Q3
select 1 a union all select 2 b = It will create a table with a column named 'a' with two rows, 1,2.
Therefore:-
a
1
2
 
select 1 a, 2 b union all select 1 a, 1 b = It will create a table with two columns ['a', 'b'] and will have two rows,
1,2
1,1
Therefore:-
a,b
1,2
1,1
 
Now, we'll perform join operation and will get following result.
 
a,a,b
1,1,1
2,1,2
 
Q4
UPDATE emp
SET Gender = CASE WHEN Gender = "M" THEN "F" ELSE "M" END;
 
Q5
1. In query 1, the joining will be based on both TeamA.Inning = TeamB.Inning AND TeamA.Inning = 2, meaning even Inning = 1 and Inning = 2 from TeamA will have NULL values in TeamB table. And all rows from TeamA will be displayed.
In query 2, the joining will be based on only TeamA.Inning = TeamB.Inning, meaning even Inning = 1 and Inning = 2 from TeamA will have values in TeamB table. But, the final output will only display a single row which is filtered using WHERE clause.
 
4. Both will have same output.
