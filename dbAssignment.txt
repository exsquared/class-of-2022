2.) Inner Join -> 7
Left outer join -> 10
Right outer join -> 14
full outer join -> 17
cross join -> 7
union all -> 18
union -> 18

4.) Update Emp
set Gender = case
when Gender = 'M' then 'F'
when Gender = 'F' then 'M'
end


5.) The difference between query1, query 2 is that the AND condition is checked on the whole table and all the matched rows and left table rows are retured after checking the whole table
wheras, in WHERE condition only the rows with WHERE condition are checked and then the result is returned.(The output here will be different).
-> In 3, 4 both will have the same output.


6.)select item as item_cart_1, item as item_cart_2 from item1 full outer join item2
where item1.item = item2.item;


8.)select distinct customer_id from orders as T1, orders as T2
where T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id
and T1.delivery_state = 'New Delhi' and T2.delivery_state = 'Mumbai';


10.)select workflow, (case1 + case2 + case3) as Passed
from table1;


7.) select * from (
(select * from FeedA
union all
select * from FeedB)
union all
select * from FeedC
) as main_table
group by main_table.listing_number, main_table.zip_code, main_table.address, main_table.city
having count(main_table.listing_number) > 1;

->insert into EMPLOYEE4
Select * from 
(
    select * from EMPLOYEE union all select * from EMPLOYEE2
) union all select * from EMPLOYEE3;

select * from EMPLOYEE4;


3.) select 1 a will create a table having column a with value 1 and select 2 b will create a table with column name b having value 2.
Therefore, union all will create table 
a 
1
2

select 1 a, 2 b union all 1 a, 1 b
a b
1 2
1 1

The former table has name a and the latter table as name b.
Hence, after applying join with particular condition the output will be (a.a = b.b) the rows which satisfy the given condition.
The final table will be 
a a b
1 1 1
2 1 2


1.) select education.id, education.name,
case 
when (education.marks > 85 and sports.marks > 85) or (sports.marks > 85 and behaviour.marks > 85) or (education.marks > 85 and behaviour.marks > 85) then 'merit'
when (education.marks > 65 and sports.marks > 65) or (sports.marks > 65 and behaviour.marks > 65) or (education.marks > 65 and behaviour.marks > 65) then 'pass'
else 'fail'
end as category
from education, sports, behaviour
where (education.id = sports.id) and (sports.id = behaviour.id);

9.) select t1.Candidates_id from Candidates as t1, Candidates as t2, Candidates as t3
where t1.Candidates_id = t2.Candidates_id and t2.Candidates_id = t3.Candidates_id 
and t1.description = 'Geologist' and t2.description = 'Astrogator' and t3.description = 'Technician';
