We’re thrilled to tap into his extensive expertise and demonstrable creativity as our new Director of Purchasing.\n\nEric, a Kansas City native, started his homebuilding career by working as a carpenter in Arizona. From there, he worked his way up through the company, a trajectory that included relocating to Chicago. At the time, his employer was the largest builder in the country, which gave Eric unmatched insight into the building process.\n\nEric also has an entrepreneurial streak, another reason we thought he’d be a great fit on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.inspired-homes.com/our-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inspired Homes team\u003c/a>. While in Chicago, Eric started a design company that specialized in the design and construction of residential and commercial projects. He also developed a line of sustainable handcrafted products including wine racks, spice racks and an iPhone stand that Eric called iSlant.\n\n“My daughter is a foodie and loves to cook, but always had her iPad laying on the kitchen counter,” he says. “I wondered how we could get the iPad off the counter so she could see it better, and I came up with the iSlant so she could more easily cook and follow recipes.”\n\nDid we mention that Eric’s also a problem-solver? That’s an especially valuable trait to have in our industry. And he’s a licensed Realtor, too, so he also understands the building industry and customer expectations from that perspective. Given his family history, it’s no surprise that Eric followed the career path he did.\n\n“My dad and grandfather were Realtors here,” he says. “My dad had three offices here in Kansas City, and my grandfather had offices in Topeka. My dad and grandfather were innovators for the time in the 1940s-1980s. Homes and building are in my blood.”\n\nNow, Eric’s next chapter begins. As our Director of Purchasing, he’ll use his accumulated knowledge while closely following the market to help ensure our building process prioritizes both quality and efficiency to deliver lasting value. He’s repeatedly helped previous employers increase their market presence while also spotting opportunities to streamline key functions like construction purchasing and estimating, and we have no doubt he’ll play a key role in helping us deliver an even better and more efficient building process for each of our clients.\n\nWelcome to the team, Eric! We’re so excited to have you with us and back in Kansas City.

While in Chicago, Eric started a design company that specialized in the design and construction of residential and commercial projects. He also developed a line of sustainable handcrafted products including wine racks, spice racks and an iPhone stand that Eric called iSlant.\n\n“My daughter is a foodie and loves to cook, but always had her iPad laying on the kitchen counter,” he says. “I wondered how we could get the iPad off the counter so she could see it better, and I came up with the iSlant so she could more easily cook and follow recipes.”\n\nDid we mention that Eric’s also a problem-solver? That’s an especially valuable trait to have in our industry. And he’s a licensed Realtor, too, so he also understands the building industry and customer expectations from that perspective. Given his family history, it’s no surprise that Eric followed the career path he did.\n\n“My dad and grandfather were Realtors here,” he says. “My dad had three offices here in Kansas City, and my grandfather had offices in Topeka. My dad and grandfather were innovators for the time in the 1940s-1980s. Homes and building are in my blood.”\n\nNow, Eric’s next chapter begins. As our Director of Purchasing, he’ll use his accumulated knowledge while closely following the market to help ensure our building process prioritizes both quality and efficiency to deliver lasting value. He’s repeatedly helped previous employers increase their market presence while also spotting opportunities to streamline key functions like construction purchasing and estimating, and we have no doubt he’ll play a key role in helping us deliver an even better and more efficient building process for each of our clients.\n\nWelcome to the team, Eric! We’re so excited to have you with us and back in Kansas City. To borrow a beloved phrase from literature and film: “There’s no place like home!”","title":"Creativity Meets Experience: Inspired Homes Welcomes New Director of Purchasing","uniqueName":"creativity-meets-experience-inspired-homes-welcomes-new-director-of-purchasing-by-inspired-homes"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","_created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","_etag":"d5655882b7a010c9e0e563a6a0564b0e1e7ec45e","_id":"5ebd4bb54db0482926f40bb0","_links":{"self":{"href":"blogposts/5ebd4bb54db0482926f40bb0","title":"blogpost"}},"_updated":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","builder":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","builder_id":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","date":"2015-05-15T14:54:08","dateUnix":1431701648,"htmlbody":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":""},"published":true,"tags":"","textbody":"","title":"house_test","uniqueName":"housetest-by-inspired-homes"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","_created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","_etag":"51c386cf60da56be82c1b2ad7c17b374ce6ca906","_id":"5ebd4bb54db0482923f4246f","_links":{"self":{"href":"blogposts/5ebd4bb54db0482923f4246f","title":"blogpost"}},"_updated":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","builder":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","builder_id":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","date":"2015-05-15T15:23:35","dateUnix":1431703415,"htmlbody":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":""},"published":true,"tags":"","textbody":"","title":"traditional-home-office","uniqueName":"traditionalhomeoffice-by-inspired-homes"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","_created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","_etag":"3e5b17aef93fd4c8c2c0acaf795f7d8999b8dcbd","_id":"5ebd4bb54db0482924f3ecf4","_links":{"self":{"href":"blogposts/5ebd4bb54db0482924f3ecf4","title":"blogpost"}},"_updated":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:46:29 GMT","builder":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","builder_id":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","date":"2015-02-09T22:26:05","dateUnix":1423520765,"htmlbody":"Morbi dapibus enim in mi porta pharetra.

In fact, relishing a bit of daylight can make a big difference in how people feel, think, and perform – even during our stormy winter season in the Midwest.\n\nSunlight provides nutrition for human beings. Natural light helps to produce Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D. Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that helps alleviate depression, aids in the absorption of other vitamins and minerals, and may help minimize the chances of developing several types of cancer. People who tend to stay indoors and out of the sun may develop fatigue, depression, headaches, and even seasonal affective disorder. Just fifteen or twenty minutes spent in natural light each day can make a huge difference.\n\nStudies have shown that people who are able to work near windows or in spaces equipped with a skylight tend to be less prone to negative emotions, are able to focus on tasks with greater ease, and in general are more productive and happy with their work.\n\nWhy does light have such a huge effect on us? It has to do with our circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are biological, mental and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour cycle and respond to light and darkness within an organism’s environment. Circadian rhythms are found in almost every living thing, human beings, animals, plants and even tiny microbes.\n\nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within the body, but they are affected by signals from the environment. Light is the main cue influencing circadian rhythms. Exposure to light turns the genes that control our internal clocks \"on\" and \"off.\"&nbsp; Our brains receive information about light through the retina. The retina contains photoreceptors that are used for vision, but also contains specialized cells that are photosensitive and project directly to the brain where they guide our master circadian clock to synchronize biological rhythms.\n\nCircadian rhythms dictate sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature and other important bodily functions. Abnormal circadian rhythms are directly linked to sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes, depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder.\n\n\u003cstrong>Bottom line?\u003c/strong>&nbsp; Sufficient exposure to light – natural daylight if possible – will help you sleep better, feel better and perform better at work.\n\n\u003cem>Inspired Homes is a custom homebuilder dedicated to changing the way homes are built in Kansas City, Missouri.

Circadian rhythms are found in almost every living thing, human beings, animals, plants and even tiny microbes.\n\nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within the body, but they are affected by signals from the environment. Light is the main cue influencing circadian rhythms. Exposure to light turns the genes that control our internal clocks \"on\" and \"off.\"&nbsp; Our brains receive information about light through the retina. The retina contains photoreceptors that are used for vision, but also contains specialized cells that are photosensitive and project directly to the brain where they guide our master circadian clock to synchronize biological rhythms.\n\nCircadian rhythms dictate sleep-wake cycles, hormone release, body temperature and other important bodily functions. Abnormal circadian rhythms are directly linked to sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes, depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder.\n\nBottom line?&nbsp; Sufficient exposure to light – natural daylight if possible – will help you sleep better, feel better and perform better at work.\n\nInspired Homes is a custom homebuilder dedicated to changing the way homes are built in Kansas City, Missouri.

Taylor was surprised by—and grateful for—the reaction.\n\n“I can’t think of another employer that I’ve worked for that would have that reaction, that it’s no big deal,” Taylor says.\n\nUpon returning from his training, Taylor wanted to do something for Aaron to show his gratitude.

After all, too much water not only causes exterior damage, but can also cause interior flooding and other potentially costly issues.\n\nJames Hardie siding, however, is built to protect your home against water damage. The fiber cement siding and trim are designed to shed water and withstand damage from both moisture and rot. And even in the event of prolonged water exposure, Hardie siding won’t absorb water and warp like engineered wood product siding.\n\n(Note: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/vXAu83h7CyA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watch the Learn, Build, Live episode\u003c/a> and you’ll see two samples that have been soaked in water since \u003cstrong>2013!\u003c/strong> The difference is incredible).\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Fire Resistance Provides Peace of Mind (and Insurance Savings)\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nWhen you consider other at-home dangers, fire is among the most frightening. The good news? James Hardie siding is fire resistant. But, as Kirk Calhoon points out in the Learn, Build, Live episode, the siding won’t catch fire, even when a blow torch is aimed directly on it!\n\nNot only do you get peace of mind from increased fire protection, but many homeowners also find that their insurance companies offer them a discounted rate if they use Hardie siding, thanks to its proven track record at minimizing threats like fires.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Keeps Pests Away\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nWood siding—whether OSB or wood-composite—is like a buffet to insects and other pests, including woodpeckers. But because Hardie siding is fiber cement, it offers little appeal to pests and won’t be invaded by termites.\n\nPlus, Hardie installation instructions (more on those in a moment) require that the siding be installed off the ground, which further protects your home from pest-related damage.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Certified Installation Ensures Consistent Application\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nAaron Roan, our director of construction and operations, says it best:\n\n“You can have the best materials, but if they’re not installed properly, they won’t work.”\n\nIn addition to producing top-of-the-line fiber cement, James Hardie also created installation guides used by certified installers to ensure correct, consistent application of Hardie siding.\n\nAnd at Inspired Homes, we take that attention to detail one step further and monitor each Hardie installation as it happens, further ensuring the integrity of the product and the process.\n\nTake a look at the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/vXAu83h7CyA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn, Build, Live episode\u003c/a> on James Hardie siding for more info about the product, how it’s installed and why it’s such an ideal choice for Kansas City-area homes.

But, as Kirk Calhoon points out in the Learn, Build, Live episode, the siding won’t catch fire, even when a blow torch is aimed directly on it!\n\nNot only do you get peace of mind from increased fire protection, but many homeowners also find that their insurance companies offer them a discounted rate if they use Hardie siding, thanks to its proven track record at minimizing threats like fires.\nKeeps Pests Away\nWood siding—whether OSB or wood-composite—is like a buffet to insects and other pests, including woodpeckers. But because Hardie siding is fiber cement, it offers little appeal to pests and won’t be invaded by termites.\n\nPlus, Hardie installation instructions (more on those in a moment) require that the siding be installed off the ground, which further protects your home from pest-related damage.\nCertified Installation Ensures Consistent Application\nAaron Roan, our director of construction and operations, says it best:\n\n“You can have the best materials, but if they’re not installed properly, they won’t work.”\n\nIn addition to producing top-of-the-line fiber cement, James Hardie also created installation guides used by certified installers to ensure correct, consistent application of Hardie siding.\n\nAnd at Inspired Homes, we take that attention to detail one step further and monitor each Hardie installation as it happens, further ensuring the integrity of the product and the process.\n\nTake a look at the Learn, Build, Live episode on James Hardie siding for more info about the product, how it’s installed and why it’s such an ideal choice for Kansas City-area homes. And if you haven’t already, be sure to like our Facebook page to get updates on upcoming Learn, Build, Live episodes and other Inspired Homes news!","title":"4 Reasons Why Inspired Homes Uses James Hardie Siding","uniqueName":"4-reasons-why-inspired-homes-uses-james-hardie-siding-by-inspired-homes"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","_created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:47:49 GMT","_etag":"64cdce9cb598108e241166e1ab1b01b2d173a700","_id":"5ebd4c054db0482927f3f8f8","_links":{"self":{"href":"blogposts/5ebd4c054db0482927f3f8f8","title":"blogpost"}},"_updated":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:47:49 GMT","builder":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","builder_id":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","date":"2018-03-07T10:30:40","dateUnix":1520418640,"htmlbody":"\u003ca href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildercloud/d89c53543762f36b377b74e205efe32c.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3540\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildercloud/d89c53543762f36b377b74e205efe32c.jpg\" alt=\"professional builder 40 under 40\" width=\"278\" height=\"300\" />\u003c/a>\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce that our own Aaron Roan, Director of Construction and Operations, is among \u003cem>Professional Builder\u003c/em> magazine’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.probuilder.com/professional-builders-2018-40-under-40#DNielsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“40 Under 40” award winners\u003c/a>!\n\nThe national award is given annually to deserving young leaders in the homebuilding industry that excel in various areas such as career progress, technical achievement and community service, according to the magazine.\n\nThat criteria fits Aaron to a “T.” Since joining the Inspired Homes team in the summer of 2016, he’s been instrumental to our success.

But, how do you know when it’s time to move up from your current home and begin to look for the new home of your dreams? Usually, if you feel you have outgrown your existing home due to lack of space or if your quality of life is suffering, it’s time to look at other options. For some families, a new addition to the family or a job promotion is the spur for making a move. In other cases, the move to a new home is the result of years of planning and saving.\n\nWhatever the motivation, many people choose to build a new home when they’re ready to move up. What are the Top 10 reasons for buying a new home in a new community?\n\n1. You’re tired of living in a house designed by someone else. If you buy a newly built home, you can select your own cabinets, granite countertops, carpets and hardwood flooring. Your new home will reflect your style, not someone else's taste.\n\n2. No matter how you scrub, that bathroom (or kitchen) never feels clean enough. While you can learn to deal with ancient appliances (and stained bathtubs), more and more people prefer that never lived-in feel.\n\n3. You’re currently living in an older home, and you’ve had the stressful and expensive experience of replacing things – water heaters, siding, carpeting. A new home ends all of that since everything is new. You’ll be able to enjoy years of comfort and peace of mind before needing to fix or replace anything.\n\n4. You feel like your money would be better spent elsewhere. New homes, like ours, are more energy efficient, exceeding minimum insulation requirements, with double-paned windows. You’ll save energy and money in both the heating and cooling seasons.\n\n5. You’d like to spend your weekends on something other than home-related chores. Today's new homes are built with cutting-edge building products that require less care and maintenance. Another plus? The latest building systems and components are designed and engineered to work together.\n\n6. You’ve decided that “quaint” and “charming” are actually code for “old” and “outdated”. You’d really love to have a home with modern design features, as well as new appliances and systems.\n\n7. You’ve realized that you’d prefer a home without hot spots and drafts. Today's new homes meet stringent energy standards not in place in the past. They combine high-performance energy efficiency with state-of-the-art ventilation and air filtration. The result is year-round, draft-free comfort and higher indoor air quality.\n\n8. After years of overloading circuits and shoving window A/C units around, you’re kind of done.

There are a variety of moving companies that espouse green practices, from using trucks that operate with bio-fuels, to using recycled or biodegradable packing products, to how efficiently they pack your belongings to minimize trips.\n\nHere are some questions to ask:\n\n\tDo they use recycled packing materials?\n\tWill they come collect packing materials so they can be re-used?\n\tDo they have a no idling policy?\n\tDo they make an effort to reduce fuel consumption through a shortest route possible policy or speed monitoring?\n\nIf you’re handling your move on your own, be sure to rent a moving van that’s the right size for what you have to move – the smaller the van, the lower the fuel consumption. And to reduce your carbon footprint even further, load your belongings in such a way that allows you to make the fewest trips back and forth.\n\nInspired Homes is a custom homebuilder dedicated to changing the way homes are built in Kansas City.

That easy twist-of-the-knob can save 1 ½ gallons of water each minute.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>To reduce the amount of water you use with every flush, \u003cstrong>place an inexpensive float booster in your toilet tank.\u003c/strong> Or you can make your own.&nbsp;Place two inches of sand or pebbles in the bottom of two plastic bottles to weigh them down, then fill with water and screw on the lids. Place both bottles inside your toilet tank, safely way from the toilet’s operating mechanism. &nbsp;This can save 10 or more gallons of water per day.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Take a shorter shower\u003c/strong>. A long, hot shower uses five to ten gallons every unnecessary minute. Inexpensive&nbsp;low-flow shower heads&nbsp;use less than 2.5 gallons per minute and are are easy to install.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Always run&nbsp;your washing machine and dishwasher with full loads\u003c/strong>. Contrary to what your mother may have told you, most dishwasher makers recommend \u003cem>not\u003c/em> pre-rinsing dishes, which is a big water savings. In your clothes washer, avoid the permanent press cycle, which has an extra rinse cycle that uses an extra five gallons of water. If you're in the market for a new clothes washer, frontload models are the water savers.

That easy twist-of-the-knob can save 1 ½ gallons of water each minute.\n\tTo reduce the amount of water you use with every flush, place an inexpensive float booster in your toilet tank. Or you can make your own.&nbsp;Place two inches of sand or pebbles in the bottom of two plastic bottles to weigh them down, then fill with water and screw on the lids. Place both bottles inside your toilet tank, safely way from the toilet’s operating mechanism. &nbsp;This can save 10 or more gallons of water per day.\n\tTake a shorter shower. A long, hot shower uses five to ten gallons every unnecessary minute. Inexpensive&nbsp;low-flow shower heads&nbsp;use less than 2.5 gallons per minute and are are easy to install.\n\tAlways run&nbsp;your washing machine and dishwasher with full loads. Contrary to what your mother may have told you, most dishwasher makers recommend not pre-rinsing dishes, which is a big water savings. In your clothes washer, avoid the permanent press cycle, which has an extra rinse cycle that uses an extra five gallons of water. If you're in the market for a new clothes washer, frontload models are the water savers. New Energy Star-rated washers use 35-50% less water and 50% less energy per load.\n\tFix a leaking faucet. A small drip can waste 20 gallons of water per day. Larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons.\n\tUse water collected from your drainpipe to water your plants, clean your car and wash your windows. Water your garden with a watering can rather than a hose which uses 265 gallons of water an hour.\n\tRunning tap water to cool it off for drinking is wasteful. Keep a jug of water in your fridge.\n\tReduce your use of the garbage disposal. In-sink units require lots of water to operate properly. Start a&nbsp;compost pile as an alternate method of disposing food waste.\n\tInsulate your water pipes.&nbsp;Pre-slit foam insulation is an easy and inexpensive way to get hot water faster and avoid wasting water while it heats up.\n\tWhen necessary, replace household products with water-efficient versions. You can find water-efficient shower heads, faucets, toilets, washing machines, dishwashers and more.\n\nEnjoy your summer and the savings!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","title":"How to to save water around the house","uniqueName":"how-to-to-save-water-around-the-house-by-inspired-homes"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","_created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:48:31 GMT","_etag":"b33bc3c7b008cb699a513dddb973b7f6d72e16e0","_id":"5ebd4c2f4db0482926f40bbd","_links":{"self":{"href":"blogposts/5ebd4c2f4db0482926f40bbd","title":"blogpost"}},"_updated":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:48:31 GMT","builder":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","builder_id":"5707e7fbf410954eb27d3706","date":"2015-06-03T14:00:42","dateUnix":1433340042,"htmlbody":"What does the color of your home's front door say about you?\n\nIt's more than simply coordinating with the exterior paint and trim.

The underlying focus during every step of the development process was always on the consumer’s needs and wants.\n\nThe result of the project is a special series of plans designed specifically for each community, with desirable features that include expanded drop zone areas, kitchen command centers with built in tech ports, and second story lofts.

Kensington Farms includes a variety of large and small home sites including walkout and daylight options. The community is in the award winning Ray Pec school district near Summit Fair Retail Center and I-435/I-470 employment corridors.

Inspired Homes is the exclusive developer/builder of Kessler Ridge at New Longview, which will eventually include 95 single-family homes.\n\nInspired Homes is a Kansas City-based homebuilder and developer founded by Kansas City family businesses with more than six decades of experience in the construction and real estate industries.

Homeowners have peace of mind knowing that their homes are protected from exposure to leaks, mold and wood rot. Additionally, homeowners benefit from significantly lower maintenance costs for painting and caulking.\n\nKessler Ridge at New Longview is named after George Kessler, the famous landscape architect who designed R.A. Long’s iconic property that later became known as “the world’s most beautiful farm.” The new community is situated just to the north of the meticulously restored Longview Mansion and features homes and greenspace that honor the area’s rich history.\n\nResidents enjoy an abundance of amenities associated with living at Kessler Ridge at New Longview.

Yet if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed or unsure about where to go next, don’t worry. We recently offered 10 tips for buying or building your first home as part of our “Learn, Build, Live” series, which we broadcast \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/inspiredhomesco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">live on Facebook\u003c/a> once a month. If you missed the episode, we’ve recapped the 10 tips below to give you a checklist that will help you more easily and efficiently navigate the buying and building process.\n\n\u003cstrong>10. Determine if home ownership is right for you at this time.\u003c/strong> There are several benefits to home ownership, including more control over your living space, the freedom to personalize your home, the ability to have the pet you want and more privacy and security.\n\n\u003cstrong>9. Understand the financial benefits of home ownership.\u003c/strong> According to Trulia, it’s cheaper to buy than it is to rent in 100 of the country’s large metro areas by an average of 37.7%. Additional benefits include the stability of fixed mortgage payments, as compared to fluctuating rent amounts, and the ability to use the equity in your home as a financial resource at a later point in time.\n\n\u003cstrong>8. Know your credit score.\u003c/strong> This is a statistical number that ranges from 300 to 850 and depicts a person’s creditworthiness. The higher the score, the more financially trustworthy that person is considered.\n\n\u003cstrong>7. Know your facts.\u003c/strong> A number of mortgage myths continue to persist, and you’ve likely heard them. For example, you don’t necessarily need excellent or good credit to get a home loan. Loans like the FHA, USDA and VA are designed specifically for buyers with less than perfect credit. Additionally, you don’t need to put 20% down on a home purchase. FHA loans, for example, require 3.5%, while conventional loans require 5%. Other loans, like USDA, can be 100% financed for qualifying buyers, requiring no down payment.\n\n\u003cstrong>6. Get pre-approved for a home loan.\u003c/strong> This is a critical step because it equips you with the financial information you need to understand what you can buy. Pre-approval is determined by a variety of factors, including the four C’s:\n\u003cul>\n \t\u003cli>Capacity (current and future ability to make payments)\u003c/li>\n \t\u003cli>Capital/Capital Reserve (money, savings and investments)\u003c/li>\n \t\u003cli>Collateral (the home you want to purchase)\u003c/li>\n \t\u003cli>Credit (your history of paying bills and other debts on time)\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\nOne additional note? Don’t hesitate to shop around for a lender before you seek pre-approval. You may notice that many builders, like Inspired Homes, work with a preferred lender, someone that has a proven track record of responsiveness, accessibility and great customer service.\n\n\u003cstrong>5. Select a trusted builder.\u003c/strong> Building a home is, well, a big deal! And that’s why it’s important to select a trusted builder that won’t just build the home of your dreams, but also be your partner and guide throughout the process. Kevin Lau, Community Manager at \u003ca href=\"http://www.inspired-homes.com/kensington-farms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kensington Farms\u003c/a>, recommends asking a builder about the materials they use, as well as about the life expectancy of exterior materials like roof and siding.\n\nYou’ll also want to ask the builder about build time and communication expectations. It’s typical to hear from your builder at least once a week to provide you updates and other pertinent project information as the construction process is underway. Be sure, too, to ask about warranties, which will help ensure post-closing customer service and availability.\n\n\u003cstrong>4. Decide where you want to live.\u003c/strong> You know that favorite real estate saying, “Location, location, location?” It’s popular for a reason! Deciding where you’re going to build your home is just as important as choosing a builder and a floor plan. Take time to learn about a \u003ca href=\"http://www.inspired-homes.com/inspired-homes-communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new home community\u003c/a>, including school district ratings and what’s nearby, like shopping, dining, services, arts, recreation and hospitals. Also, does the community offer any amenities? And if so, are there any associated fees?\n\n\u003cstrong>3. Tour builder welcome centers and model homes.\u003c/strong> Most communities and builders offer welcome centers and model homes that prospective buyers can tour to learn more about a builder, floor plans and a community. While you’re there, take note of your first impression. Is the staff helpful and knowledgeable? What do you think of the model home’s construction?\n\n\u003cstrong>2. Examine the floor plans.\u003c/strong> Do they include the latest and greatest designs? And does the builder use a professional interior designer? It’s a good idea to find out more about who’s involved in the building process. Ideally, it’s more efficient to have a single point of contact, rather than having to chase down several people for answers and updates.\n\n\u003cstrong>1. Visit an Inspired Homes sales center.\u003c/strong> If you have lingering questions about the buying or building process, we’d love to help. Inspired Homes has sales centers in communities around the Kansas City metro, including Kensington Farms in Lee’s Summit, Huntford in Olathe, Kessler Ridge at New Longview in Lee’s Summit and Vista at the Reserve in Lenexa.

Yet if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed or unsure about where to go next, don’t worry. We recently offered 10 tips for buying or building your first home as part of our “Learn, Build, Live” series, which we broadcast live on Facebook once a month. If you missed the episode, we’ve recapped the 10 tips below to give you a checklist that will help you more easily and efficiently navigate the buying and building process.\n\n10. Determine if home ownership is right for you at this time. There are several benefits to home ownership, including more control over your living space, the freedom to personalize your home, the ability to have the pet you want and more privacy and security.\n\n9. Understand the financial benefits of home ownership. According to Trulia, it’s cheaper to buy than it is to rent in 100 of the country’s large metro areas by an average of 37.7%. Additional benefits include the stability of fixed mortgage payments, as compared to fluctuating rent amounts, and the ability to use the equity in your home as a financial resource at a later point in time.\n\n8. Know your credit score. This is a statistical number that ranges from 300 to 850 and depicts a person’s creditworthiness. The higher the score, the more financially trustworthy that person is considered.\n\n7. Know your facts. A number of mortgage myths continue to persist, and you’ve likely heard them. For example, you don’t necessarily need excellent or good credit to get a home loan. Loans like the FHA, USDA and VA are designed specifically for buyers with less than perfect credit. Additionally, you don’t need to put 20% down on a home purchase. FHA loans, for example, require 3.5%, while conventional loans require 5%. Other loans, like USDA, can be 100% financed for qualifying buyers, requiring no down payment.\n\n6. Get pre-approved for a home loan. This is a critical step because it equips you with the financial information you need to understand what you can buy. Pre-approval is determined by a variety of factors, including the four C’s:\n\n \tCapacity (current and future ability to make payments)\n \tCapital/Capital Reserve (money, savings and investments)\n \tCollateral (the home you want to purchase)\n \tCredit (your history of paying bills and other debts on time)\n\nOne additional note? Don’t hesitate to shop around for a lender before you seek pre-approval. You may notice that many builders, like Inspired Homes, work with a preferred lender, someone that has a proven track record of responsiveness, accessibility and great customer service.\n\n5. Select a trusted builder. Building a home is, well, a big deal! And that’s why it’s important to select a trusted builder that won’t just build the home of your dreams, but also be your partner and guide throughout the process. Kevin Lau, Community Manager at Kensington Farms, recommends asking a builder about the materials they use, as well as about the life expectancy of exterior materials like roof and siding.\n\nYou’ll also want to ask the builder about build time and communication expectations. It’s typical to hear from your builder at least once a week to provide you updates and other pertinent project information as the construction process is underway. Be sure, too, to ask about warranties, which will help ensure post-closing customer service and availability.\n\n4. Decide where you want to live. You know that favorite real estate saying, “Location, location, location?” It’s popular for a reason! Deciding where you’re going to build your home is just as important as choosing a builder and a floor plan. Take time to learn about a new home community, including school district ratings and what’s nearby, like shopping, dining, services, arts, recreation and hospitals. Also, does the community offer any amenities? And if so, are there any associated fees?\n\n3. Tour builder welcome centers and model homes. Most communities and builders offer welcome centers and model homes that prospective buyers can tour to learn more about a builder, floor plans and a community. While you’re there, take note of your first impression. Is the staff helpful and knowledgeable? What do you think of the model home’s construction?\n\n2. Examine the floor plans. Do they include the latest and greatest designs? And does the builder use a professional interior designer? It’s a good idea to find out more about who’s involved in the building process. Ideally, it’s more efficient to have a single point of contact, rather than having to chase down several people for answers and updates.\n\n1. Visit an Inspired Homes sales center. If you have lingering questions about the buying or building process, we’d love to help. Inspired Homes has sales centers in communities around the Kansas City metro, including Kensington Farms in Lee’s Summit, Huntford in Olathe, Kessler Ridge at New Longview in Lee’s Summit and Vista at the Reserve in Lenexa. Customer satisfaction is our top priority, and we’d love to help in any way we can.\n\nIf you’d like additional information about any of the tips we just mentioned, feel free to watch the full recap of “Learn, Build, Live,” episode 3:\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, be sure to like us on Facebook and stay tuned to our blog for information, resources and tips on home buying, building and ownership.

If you’re looking to spruce up your own home, consider these tips from Sherry to get a polished, inviting aesthetic (without breaking the bank!)\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>5 Home Design Tips Inspired By a Model Home\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Window Treatments: An Important Focal Point\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nAll of Inspired Homes’ floor plans feature numerous windows, which makes window treatments a key part of each room. Sherry prefers professionally made window treatments, but if you opt to buy off the shelf, she recommends checking to make sure the window treatments are lined. Another tip? Hang your window treatments above the window frame, which “elongates the panel and adds visual height to the room,” she says. You can use this same trick with your shower curtains, too, to easily add depth to your bathrooms.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Don’t Be Afraid to Mix Patterns\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nForget the long-held notion that you can’t mix patterns in a room. Instead, Sherry says the key is to focus on the scale and proportion of the patterns. With similar scale and proportion, you maintain balance without minimizing the visual interest of the room. Enhance patterns with a corresponding color palette and textures. And speaking of colors? They don’t all have to match!\n\n“Your eye will bring the colors together,” Sherry says.\n\nAnd on another color note? Sherry’s a big fan of including a touch of black in every room, which “helps ground the space.” Her advice? “Don’t be afraid to grab a can of spray paint” and transform a decorative piece or vase.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Layer Your Lighting\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nLighting can be easily overlooked, yet it’s one of the things that has the biggest impact on a space.

That way, you can have different lights turned on depending on the time of day or occasion (such as entertaining vs. family time) and help set the ambiance.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Embrace Wallpaper\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nWallpaper gets a bad rap, but it’s not the enemy—we promise! Consider experimenting with a patterned or textured wallpaper in a smaller space like a powder room. And like we mentioned earlier, don’t be afraid to go with a bold pattern. Instead, focus on the scale, proportion and balance. If you do opt with a bold wallpaper, consider a simpler window treatment that’s enhanced with a bit of texture, like what’s on display in the Kensington Farms’ model home.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>Introduce the Unexpected\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nDon’t be afraid to unleash your creativity when decorating your home!

Naturally varying tones and patterns give you the versatility to match your granite countertops to a variety of tones in your home, including flooring, cabinets and hardware.\n\nQuartz, on the other hand, is made of finely ground pieces of quartz that are mixed with approximately 5 percent resin. It’s a man-made product that has a consistent color and pattern, which is one of the primary advantages of quartz.\n\nIf you’re looking for a uniform color and pattern—a beige or gray, for example—quartz is likely the best option. And in terms of cost, quartz is generally a bit more expensive than granite. As an Inspired Homes option, quartz is considered an upgrade, whereas granite is a standard inclusion.\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>How to Care for Granite and Quartz\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\nOnce your new countertops are ready, how do you care for them? The good news is that granite and quartz are both designed to be low-maintenance.\n\nBecause granite is stone, it’s porous and can absorb stains and water. That's why we recommend sealing your granite countertops every 2 to 4 years.\n\nQuartz doesn’t require sealing. And in terms of day-to-day cleaning, avoid acidic cleaners for both granite and quartz and, instead, use a simple cleaning solution of mild soap and water.\n\nIf you accidentally stain your granite countertop with something like red wine, don’t panic! Take our advice and mix a paste from baking soda and water, then apply the paste directly to the stain. The baking soda will draw the stain out of the countertop, then simply wipe away with soap and water.\n\nAnother common predicament is a chip in your countertop. Granite chips are relatively easy to repair, thanks to the varying color pattern—the repaired piece typically blends right in.\n\nQuartz, on the other hand, can pose a tougher challenge, so you’ll likely want to enlist the help of a professional.\n\nIf you have additional questions about granite and quartz countertops and what we offer in our homes, feel free to reach out to Whitney, our New Home Advisor, at woreilly\u003cat>inspired-homes.com.","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","caption":"granite vs quartz","contentUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildercloud/561f70cd0c343096003429f88bd4038e.jpg"},"published":true,"tags":"Blog, Difference Between Granite And Quartz, Granite Countertops, Granite Vs Quartz, Home Decorating, How To Clean Granite, How To Clean Quartz, Interior Decorating, Kansas City Homebuilders, Kitchen Decorating Tips, Learn Build Live, New Home Tips, New Home Tips, New Homes Kansas City, Quartz Countertops","textbody":"\n\nGranite and quartz are two of the most popular choices for countertops, but what’s the difference between the two materials—and how do you best care for each?

As you prepare for your Inspired Homes Design Studio appointment, we have 5 tips that will put you at ease when \u003ca href=\"https://www.inspired-homes.com/blog/design-dish-how-we-simplified-your-design-selection-experience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">making your design selections\u003c/a>. Instead of sending you to vendors throughout the city, we invite you to our fully appointed Design Studio so that you can make all of your design selections, interior and exterior, in one meeting. Talk about efficiency! You’ll be guided through your options by our Director of Design, Sherry Worth, who can answer questions and, in many cases, show you samples that you can see and touch. *Due to recent \u003ca href=\"http://www.inspired-homes.com/blog/customer-information-amid-covid-19/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 stay at home orders\u003c/a> we are temporarily conducting virtual Design Studio appointments. Clients will be sent a full material catalog, cabinet plans, and shower options ahead of time to conduct a little due diligence and shopping. &nbsp;Our Director of Design will set up a meeting via Skype to discuss these options in further detail. Before you arrive in the Design Studio or attend virtually, there are a few things you can do to make your appointment even more enjoyable. Think of the following checklist like homework — but the fun kind! \u003cstrong>1. Know your budget — and priorities.&nbsp;\u003c/strong> The most important piece of information you need before your Design Studio appointment is your budget. All Inspired Homes’ floor plans include an array of standard options. Then, buyers can choose from upgraded selections in each of the design finish categories, which is where your budget becomes a critical factor. In addition to knowing your budget, it also helps to identify your priorities. Where do you want to invest more money in your home? If the kitchen is your primary focus, for example, understand how you want to equip the kitchen and how you want it to look. Then, would you be willing to go with standard options in other areas of the home so that you can stay on budget? It’s easy to get overwhelmed by your options. By setting parameters ahead of time, you’ll be more likely to stay on track in the Design Studio and ensure you maximize your design investment. \u003cstrong>2. Balance trendy and timeless.\u003c/strong> Part of the exhilaration of building a home is making it yours. We’ve carefully curated our design selections to include a mix of trendy and timeless looks. Sherry is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to establishing your home’s aesthetic, so don’t hesitate to ask her input as you’re making your choices. This is another area where your design priorities will be helpful. Are you interested in home interior trends? If so, where are those focal points in your own home? Maybe you’d want to draw the eye with a patterned tile kitchen backsplash, tempered with the timeless appeal (not to mention durability) of quartz countertops. When you work with Inspired Homes, your home is built to last. And we can also help you make design choices with longevity in mind. \u003cstrong>3. Take notes and photos.\u003c/strong> Each of your design selections will be carefully documented during your Design Studio appointment, but you’re encouraged to take your own notes and photos. We know you’ll want to share your selections with your nearest and dearest! Plus, having the info handy can help you with other pre-move-in tasks like furniture shopping. Forgot to note a selection? No problem. Reach out to our team any time and we’ll be happy to make sure you have the information you need. \u003cstrong>4. Prioritize function over fashion.&nbsp;\u003c/strong> The key to successful interior design is to create a space that you love and can live in. Just as you want to balance trendy selections with timeless options, you also want to blend function and fashion so that your home looks beautiful and helps you live a better life. With that said, don’t be surprised if you want to make a few design changes after you’re moved in. Sherry recommends giving yourself at least six months to live in and use the space, then determine what — if any — tweaks need to be made. That’s another advantage to working with Inspired Homes and our Design Studio. Although you have options, you don’t have to feel overwhelmed by picking every single option and finish from scratch. Instead, you’ll choose what works for you, your floor plan, your budget, your lifestyle, from our curated selection. Think of it this way — we’ve picked the best options in each category, so you just need to make decisions based on what’s best for you and your home. \u003cstrong>5.

As you prepare for your Inspired Homes Design Studio appointment, we have 5 tips that will put you at ease when making your design selections. Instead of sending you to vendors throughout the city, we invite you to our fully appointed Design Studio so that you can make all of your design selections, interior and exterior, in one meeting. Talk about efficiency! You’ll be guided through your options by our Director of Design, Sherry Worth, who can answer questions and, in many cases, show you samples that you can see and touch. *Due to recent COVID-19 stay at home orders we are temporarily conducting virtual Design Studio appointments. Clients will be sent a full material catalog, cabinet plans, and shower options ahead of time to conduct a little due diligence and shopping. &nbsp;Our Director of Design will set up a meeting via Skype to discuss these options in further detail. Before you arrive in the Design Studio or attend virtually, there are a few things you can do to make your appointment even more enjoyable. Think of the following checklist like homework — but the fun kind! 1. Know your budget — and priorities.&nbsp; The most important piece of information you need before your Design Studio appointment is your budget. All Inspired Homes’ floor plans include an array of standard options. Then, buyers can choose from upgraded selections in each of the design finish categories, which is where your budget becomes a critical factor. In addition to knowing your budget, it also helps to identify your priorities. Where do you want to invest more money in your home? If the kitchen is your primary focus, for example, understand how you want to equip the kitchen and how you want it to look. Then, would you be willing to go with standard options in other areas of the home so that you can stay on budget? It’s easy to get overwhelmed by your options. By setting parameters ahead of time, you’ll be more likely to stay on track in the Design Studio and ensure you maximize your design investment. 2. Balance trendy and timeless. Part of the exhilaration of building a home is making it yours. We’ve carefully curated our design selections to include a mix of trendy and timeless looks. Sherry is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to establishing your home’s aesthetic, so don’t hesitate to ask her input as you’re making your choices. This is another area where your design priorities will be helpful. Are you interested in home interior trends? If so, where are those focal points in your own home? Maybe you’d want to draw the eye with a patterned tile kitchen backsplash, tempered with the timeless appeal (not to mention durability) of quartz countertops. When you work with Inspired Homes, your home is built to last. And we can also help you make design choices with longevity in mind. 3. Take notes and photos. Each of your design selections will be carefully documented during your Design Studio appointment, but you’re encouraged to take your own notes and photos. We know you’ll want to share your selections with your nearest and dearest! Plus, having the info handy can help you with other pre-move-in tasks like furniture shopping. Forgot to note a selection? No problem. Reach out to our team any time and we’ll be happy to make sure you have the information you need. 4. Prioritize function over fashion.&nbsp; The key to successful interior design is to create a space that you love and can live in. Just as you want to balance trendy selections with timeless options, you also want to blend function and fashion so that your home looks beautiful and helps you live a better life. With that said, don’t be surprised if you want to make a few design changes after you’re moved in. Sherry recommends giving yourself at least six months to live in and use the space, then determine what — if any — tweaks need to be made. That’s another advantage to working with Inspired Homes and our Design Studio. Although you have options, you don’t have to feel overwhelmed by picking every single option and finish from scratch. Instead, you’ll choose what works for you, your floor plan, your budget, your lifestyle, from our curated selection. Think of it this way — we’ve picked the best options in each category, so you just need to make decisions based on what’s best for you and your home. 5. Be confident in your choices. Although we present you with a carefully curated range of options, you still have choices. And it’s natural to second-guess some of your decisions once you leave the Design Studio. Yet that’s another advantage to building with us. Your Design Studio experience is guided by our knowledgeable Director of Design.

There are a lot of steps to consider when deciding whether to take the plunge or stick with renting. One of the main concerns is finances. Luckily, if you buy a home in Kansas City, you will be pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous homes, spacious yards, and affordable costs. But, like any important decision, it is vital to consider the pros and cons when deciding if it is&nbsp;better to rent or buy a home.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a renter, you may enjoy not having as much responsibility and being able to freely move once your lease is at term. However, as nice as it may be just to call your landlord to fix a leaking faucet or broken fridge, you are limited in several things that can be troublesome:No control over the appearance of the house and propertyLittle to no yardMaintenance decisions including time and quality personnel are not yours to makeUnable to control things like water pressure, and utility replacementsOwner can sell the property at any timeWhereas, by purchasing you get to make all the decisions on your home and property. You no longer must wait for a landlord to make a call to a plumber or for the landlord to fix that leak in the ceiling. You can decide what electrician to use and that yes, replacing a dishwasher is indeed worth the cost. It’s also&nbsp;cheaper in the long run.&nbsp;Owning a home in a neighborhood means your neighbors, being homeowners themselves, will likely be more inclined to take care of their properties which can improve the value of your home and make a big impact on an appraisal should you ever decide to sell.&nbsp;Other benefits include:Full customization over appearance and functionality of the homeTax breaks (especially if you work from home)Paying for your own property rather than a mortgage for someone elseCheaper in the long runBetter security and privacyPredictable paymentsNo risk of evictionImage via&nbsp;Flickr&nbsp;by @alexandermillsFinances are usually the biggest dealbreaker when buying a home, but it doesn’t have to be. Rates are still historically low, and timing is everything in real estate. Deciding to own a home is not just about what you want to get for a certain price, it’s when you want to get it for the right price. Investopedia has a great article to help you learn how to analyze factors that can effect your&nbsp;readiness to buy a home.&nbsp;Deciding where to live is also a key consideration. Researching school districts, commute times, and activities will all play a role in where to&nbsp;buy your Kansas City home.&nbsp;At Inspired Living, we offer a variety of homes in&nbsp;safe neighborhoods&nbsp;to help you make the right choice.

From paperwork to final inspections there are many steps to take before the first moving box is unpacked. But by purchasing a home through Inspired Homes, you have a partner that can guide you through all of the steps to buying a house.Steps to HomeownershipThrough the Inspired Homeowner Experience, we will create a step-by-step plan with you so you can be sure of a seamless transition into homeownership. In this article, we will guide you through the paperwork and selection processes for buying and building an Inspired Home.&nbsp;Loan QualificationBefore you decide on a home, you will want to get pre-qualified for a home loan. This is an important step as you prepare to find the home that will fit your budget and your life. Gather the following paperwork and meet with a lender to get pre-qualified.Your lender will want to see:Pay Stubs&nbsp;– You will need to provide at minimum one 30 days of paystubs, (60 days is better). This shows the lender that you have a stable income and will be able to pay your mortgage each month.&nbsp;Employer Contact Information&nbsp;- Your paystubs will usually count as proof of employment, but some lenders require a letter or some other document from your employer to confirm your hire date and employment status.Tax Documents&nbsp;– Your lender will also require at least two years of tax returns and W-2’s to further support your ability to make your loan payments over the life of the loan – usually 30 years.&nbsp;Bank Statements&nbsp;– Lenders will also want 30-60 days of transaction history.Business Documents&nbsp;– If you are self-employed, the lender will want to see your signed tax returns as well as profit and loss statements.Debt Information&nbsp;– The qualification of your loan is calculated by your debt-to-income ratio. Your lender will need information on any outstanding loans (car payments, mortgages, credit card debt, etc.) &nbsp;to see how your monthly income is affected.Residential History&nbsp;– To further support your ability to make a loan payment, you will need to provide two years of home addresses and contact information for any landlords.Additional Income&nbsp;– This includes social security benefits, disability, pension, dividends or bonuses, etc. You are not required to disclose any child support or alimony payments, just whatever is applicable to your loan and debt-to-income ratio.Assets&nbsp;– Your lender will ask for statements showing values of any CDs, IRAs, stocks, bonds, other securities and any money being used for the down payment.Earnest Money and Source&nbsp;– Once you make an offer on the property and you will need to provide earnest money. This is a deposit held in an escrow fund that serves as proof of your intent to purchase the home. You will also need to provide proof of where the money came from. A PDF showing your bank history or a letter from someone who gave you the money for the down payment may also be necessary.After the paperwork is turned in and you have been prequalified, contact&nbsp;Inspired Homes&nbsp;for exceptional service as we guide you through our building and buying process.&nbsp;Finding HomeWe have&nbsp;beautiful pre-built homes&nbsp;available in many locations. These quality homes are built with the same quality and passion you would have if you were to build your dream home.

This is the perfect solution if you need a new home fast.If you choose to buy land and build a custom home, we will be with you every step of the way. You will first decide on where you want to live. Inspired Homes has housing in&nbsp;six communities:Arbor CrossingHuntfordKensington FarmsKessler RidgeLakeshore MeadowsThe ReserveDesign ConsultationAfter you’ve chosen where you want to live, it’s time to decide what you want to live in.

Our&nbsp;Design Studio&nbsp;is your one-stop shop to every customizable element you can think of.

The project manager and community manager are your partners through the entire Inspired Homebuyers Experience.At this meeting, we will review and confirm your plan selections and timelines.InspectionsInspired Homes take quality seriously and each site has a project manager and community manager to ensure things are running smoothly. Official inspections will be done as progress on your house is made.Foundation Quality Inspection:&nbsp;Inspectors will check elevations, look for cracks, damaged walls, floors, and other issues.Frame Inspection:&nbsp;Inspectors check the home’s structure including the roof, walls, attic or crawl spaces, and determine load bearing and retaining walls and proper framing has been set in place.Mechanical Inspection:&nbsp;Inspectors will examine plumbing, electrical, and HVAC installations. These inspections verify that proper wiring is connected, ensure duct work is sending air to the right places, and that plumbing pipes are hooked up correctly.After inspections are complete, you will have a Pre-Drywall Orientation which gives you the first chance to really envision what the house will look like. You’ll be able to walk the floor plan, see the rooms, and we will explain how all of the electrical and plumbing will flow.Once your walk-through is complete, there are two final inspections that will occur:Trim and Drywall Inspection:&nbsp;Inspectors check for correct use of fasteners like screws and nails and ensure none are missing or loose, crooked or incorrect electrical outlets, and correctly staggered joints to ensure walls and doors are aligned appropriately.Quality Assurance Inspection:&nbsp;Your project manager will perform a final inspection and then a representative from Inspired Homes will perform an additional inspection to ensure your home is ready for closing.In these inspections, other information on things like electrical wiring issues, framing, foundation slabs, footings, firestop material, pier pads, retaining walls, studs and more. The nice thing about these inspections is that reports usually include photos and details about the home that you probably didn’t know!New Home OrientationWhen your home is finally complete, we will help you learn all about your new home with our orientation. This is your first chance to see how all of the elements tie together and see the features you selected brought to life. Your project or warranty manager will take you on a tour of your entire house, answer any questions you have and provide any information you need.ClosingThe closing process commences after the home is complete, this is where ownership of the home transfers from the seller to the buyer.

A gentle soap with warm water on a soft cloth is best to keep granite from dulling and scratching.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Clean up any spills as soon as possible to avoid the chance of liquids seeping into the porous material and leaving a stain.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Granite counters usually come sealed, however, the sealant can wear down with regular wear and tear. It’s recommended to reseal granite every two to four years or when spills become difficult to clean.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Always dry granite after cleaning it with a soft cloth. Allowing extra water and cleaner on granite can dull the natural material.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Try out specialized granite countertop cleaners. Though regular soap and water will do just fine, specialized cleaners can help increase the longevity of your counters and add extra shine.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">For tough stains, try baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with water to get rid of an oil-based stain and mix baking soda with hydrogen peroxide for a water-based stain. Gently scrub the paste on the stain with a soft cloth.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Though granite can handle heat, do not place any hot objects directly on your granite counters. This can lead to discoloration and permanent damage to your counters.\u003c/li>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Do not use any sharp tools or knives directly on granite counters; always make sure to use a cutting board.\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\u003cp dir=\"ltr\">\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildercloud/0e07cf291bd93318dda2c29b5bf215ba.jpeg\" style=\"width: 300%;\" class=\"fr-dii\" data-filename=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildercloud/0e07cf291bd93318dda2c29b5bf215ba.jpeg\">\u003c/p>\u003cp dir=\"ltr\">\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp dir=\"ltr\">How to Maintain Quartz:\u003cbr>Since quartz is engineered--about 90% is made of natural material with the rest made of resin--it’s not porous and more durable against heat and stains, which makes it relatively easy to care for.\u003c/p>\u003cul>\u003cli dir=\"ltr\">Clean quartz with mild soap and warm water and a soft cloth.

A gentle soap with warm water on a soft cloth is best to keep granite from dulling and scratching.Clean up any spills as soon as possible to avoid the chance of liquids seeping into the porous material and leaving a stain.Granite counters usually come sealed, however, the sealant can wear down with regular wear and tear. It’s recommended to reseal granite every two to four years or when spills become difficult to clean.Always dry granite after cleaning it with a soft cloth. Allowing extra water and cleaner on granite can dull the natural material.Try out specialized granite countertop cleaners. Though regular soap and water will do just fine, specialized cleaners can help increase the longevity of your counters and add extra shine.For tough stains, try baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with water to get rid of an oil-based stain and mix baking soda with hydrogen peroxide for a water-based stain. Gently scrub the paste on the stain with a soft cloth.Though granite can handle heat, do not place any hot objects directly on your granite counters. This can lead to discoloration and permanent damage to your counters.Do not use any sharp tools or knives directly on granite counters; always make sure to use a cutting board.How to Maintain Quartz:Since quartz is engineered--about 90% is made of natural material with the rest made of resin--it’s not porous and more durable against heat and stains, which makes it relatively easy to care for.Clean quartz with mild soap and warm water and a soft cloth. Do not use abrasive cleaners or sponges, which can discolor or damage quartz. You can opt for a specialized quartz cleaner, though it’s not necessary.After cleaning, immediately rinse quartz from all cleaners and dry with a soft cloth.To get rid of tougher stains try Goo Gone (if it’s sticky), isopropyl rubbing alcohol, and, in some cases, a quartz-safe glass cleaner can do the trick.Like granite, you should clean up any spills immediately to prevent any stainage. Take caution with any citrus-based liquids around quartz counters, as these can easily stain and damage.Do not place extremely hot objects directly on quartz counters.Though quartz is scratch resistant, it is not completely scratch-less; do not use any sharp tools directly on quartz.Proper maintenance of your granite and quartz counters will ensure that your counters remain durable and perfectly shiny.&nbsp;Looking to build your dream home with granite or quartz countertops?
